    "1. Access Control\n",
    "Access control in encapsulation refers to the regulation of who can access and modify the internal attributes (data) of a class. In Python, access \n",
    "control is enforced primarily through naming conventions, though the language does not enforce strict access rules like other languages (e.g., C++ or \n",

    "'''\n",
    "'''\n",
    "2. Data Hiding\n",
    "Data hiding is the practice of restricting access to an object's internal state. By hiding the internal data and only exposing necessary methods (via a controlled interface), the class ensures that its internal representation can be modified without affecting the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents Direct Access: By hiding the internal attributes and requiring that data manipulation happens through specific methods (such as getters and setters), you can control how data is accessed or modified.\n",

    "''''Name mangling is a technique used by Python to make an attribute or method more \"private\" by altering its name in a way that prevents accidental \n",
    "access or modification from outside the class. This is primarily used for private variables and methods in order to avoid name conflicts in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, name mangling is triggered when you define a variable with two leading underscores (__) and no trailing underscores. Python changes the name \n",

    "avoid accidental name clashes in subclasses, rather than to provide strong encapsulation like in some other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Name Mangling Works:\n",
    "When an attribute or method name starts with two underscores (__) but does not end with two underscores (like __name), Python mangles the name by \n",
    "prefixing the class name. This process makes it more difficult (but not impossible) to access or override that attribute or method outside the class.\n",

    "How Name Mangling Affects Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is about restricting access to the internal state of an object and only allowing it to be modified through controlled access methods\n",
    "(getters and setters). Name mangling helps with this by making private attributes or methods more difficult to access directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, name mangling does not make the attribute truly private. It merely makes it less likely to be accessed or overridden by accident, and it \n",
    "provides a mechanism to avoid name clashes in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is still possible to access name-mangled variables, though doing so is discouraged. Name mangling is mainly for preventing accidental access and \n",
